#NLP Notes
* NLP - Natural Language Processing
* NLP also referred as text analytics

* Applications of NLP
- POS --> Parts Of Speech
- NER - named Entity Recognition
- Twitter opinion mining (unsupervised analysis)
- Semantics

TEXT ANALYTICS: AREAS OF APPLICATION
- Banking and loan processing
- Insurance claim processing
- Customer relationship processing
- security and counter-terroism
- social media analytics
- computational social science
- E-commerce
- Psychology and cognitive service.

* Analytics on text is similar to sequence of words.

* Three Modules of Text Analytics
 - Lexical Processing
 - Syntactic Processing
 - Semantic Processing

* Lexical Processing: Converting the raw text into words and depending upon application needs, converting into sentences and paragraphs as well.

* Syntactic Processing: Extracting more meaning from the sentence by using its syntax (syntactic structures)

Lexical and Syntactic Processing don't suffice when it comes to building advanced NLP applications such as language translation, chatbots etc. The machine after the above two processing steps will still be incapable of actually understanding the meaning of the text.

- Semantic processing: Inferring the word's meaning to the collection of words that usually occur around it. By this, the machine should also be able to understand other semantic relations.

 - In most of the applications, lexical and semantic processing simply form the pre-processing layer of the overall process. sometimes only lexical is used as pre-processing step.
